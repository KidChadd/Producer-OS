> Current Version: v0.1.1

Producer-OS is a safety-first, rule-driven file organizer for music producers.  
It organizes sample packs, audio files, MIDI packs, presets, and DAW project files using structured JSON rules and schema validation.

Built with Python and PySide6, it provides:

- A desktop GUI application  
- A command-line interface (CLI) for automation workflows  

---

# What Is Producer-OS?

Producer-OS is a rule-based sample pack organizer designed for serious music production environments.

It helps producers manage:

- Drum kits  
- Sample packs  
- WAV files  
- MIDI packs  
- FL Studio projects  
- Presets and production assets  

Instead of relying only on file extensions or folder names, Producer-OS evaluates files using configurable JSON rules validated by JSON schemas.

Unmatched files are routed to **UNSORTED**.  
Unsafe or flagged files are routed to **Quarantine**.  
Every action is logged and traceable.

---

- CLI for scripted and headless workflows  
- Detailed logging of file decisions  
- Automatic UNSORTED and Quarantine routing  
- Modular architecture

All configurations are validated against JSON schemas before execution.  
Invalid configurations block execution.

---

# Safety Model

Producer-OS enforces:

- No file deletion by default  
- Schema validation before sorting  
- Routing of unmatched files to UNSORTED  
- Routing of unsafe files to Quarantine  
- Full logging of file actions  

---

# Requirements

- Python 3.11+  
- Desktop environment capable of running PySide6  
- Dependencies managed via `pyproject.toml`  

---

# Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions runs:

- Ruff (lint)  
- Mypy (type checking)  
- Pytest  
- Package build validation
