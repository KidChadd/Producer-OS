"""Bucket renaming service for Producer OS.

Producer OS uses fixed bucket identifiers internally (e.g. ``"808s"``),
but allows users to rename buckets to customise the folder names that
appear in their hub directory.  The rename mapping is stored in a
``buckets.json`` file alongside the configuration and styles files.

The :class:`BucketService` loads this mapping and provides helper
methods to translate between internal bucket IDs and user‑visible
display names.  When no mapping is present for a given bucket ID
the ID itself is returned.  The mapping is case sensitive on the
identifier side but case insensitive when looking up display names.

Structure of ``buckets.json``::

    {
      "808s": "808",        # bucket ID -> display/folder name
      "Kicks": "Kicks",
      "Snares": "Snares",
      ...
    }

This file is validated against ``buckets.schema.json`` on load.
