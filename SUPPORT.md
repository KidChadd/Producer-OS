# Getting Support

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request for Producer OS
please open an issue in the GitHub repository.  When reporting
problems include as much detail as possible about your operating
system, Python version and the steps to reproduce the issue.  Logs
can be found under the `logs` directory inside your hub folder; use
the “Export Debug Report” option in the GUI or CLI to gather
relevant files without including your audio content.

For general questions, suggestions or discussion feel free to
open a discussion thread or join our community chat (link TBD).
