# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are handled on a best-effort basis for:

- The latest tagged release
- The current `main` branch

Older releases may not receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue.

Instead, use GitHub's **Security Advisory** feature to report it privately.

Steps:

1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Security" tab.
3. Click "Report a vulnerability".
4. Submit the details privately.

We will review and respond as quickly as possible.

Thank you for helping keep Producer-OS secure.
